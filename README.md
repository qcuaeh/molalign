**MolAlignLib** is a Fortran and Python library based on random rotations and quasi-local
RMSD minimizations to align rigid molecules and clusters. The details of the method can be
found in publication [[1]](#1).

Before installing
-----------------

If you can't or don't want to install stuff on your computer you can try
[MolAlignLib on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qcuaeh/molalignlib.git/HEAD?labpath=examples/example1.ipynb).

To build the native executable you only need a Fortran 2008 compiler and LAPACK.

To install the python module you will need GFortran 4.8 or higher, LAPACK, Python 3.6 or
higher, *NumPy* and *ASE*. The easiest way to install the required packages is with your
distro's package manager:

#### RHEL, Centos, Fedora, etc.

    yum install git python3 python3-pip gcc-gfortran lapack-devel

#### Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.

    apt install git python3 python3-pip gfortran liblapack-dev

Build the native executable
---------------------------

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/qcuaeh/molalignlib.git

then enter the cloned directory, edit the *build.env* file to suit your system and run:

    ./build.sh

It will create the *molalign* executable inside the *build* directory.

or install the python module
----------------------------

Simply run:

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/qcuaeh/molalignlib.git

It will install *NumPy*, *ASE* and *MolAlignLib* in your site packages and the *molalign* script in your path.

Program options
---------------

#### Options supported by the native executable and the python script

<code>-sort</code>&nbsp; Reorder atoms to minimize the RMSD.  
<code>-fast</code>&nbsp; Prune assignments that surpass the displacement tolerance.  
<code>-tol <em>TOL</em></code>&nbsp; Set the displacement tolerance to *TOL* (defaults to 0.35 Ã…).  
<code>-out <em>NAME</em></code>&nbsp; Set the output file name to *NAME* (defaults to aligned.xyz).  
<code>-count <em>N</em></code>&nbsp; Set the count threshold to *N* (defaults to 10).  
<code>-trials <em>N</em></code>&nbsp; Set the maximum number of trials to *N*.  
<code>-rec <em>N</em></code>&nbsp; Record up to *N* assignments (defaults to 1).  
<code>-stats</code>&nbsp; Print detailed stats of the calculation.  
<code>-test</code>&nbsp; Use a fixed random seed for testing.  
<code>-mirror</code>&nbsp; Reflect aligned coordinates.  
<code>-mass</code>&nbsp; Use mass weighted RMSD.  

#### Options only supported by the native executable

<code>-live</code>&nbsp; Print stats in real time (if stats are enabled).  
<code>-stdin <em>EXT</em></code>&nbsp; Read coordinates from standard input in *EXT* format.  
<code>-stdout <em>EXT</em></code>&nbsp; Write coordinates to standard output in *EXT* format.  

Basic usage
-----------

The syntax of the command is:

    molalign [option[s]] file1 file2

The coordinates in file2 will be aligned to the coordinates in file1. If there is
more than one set of coordinates in a file, only the first one will be read. The native
executable only reads *xyz* and *mol2* files while the python script reads all the file
formats supported by *ASE*.

* To align the atoms without reordering, run the command without options.

* To reorder the atoms to minimize the RMSD run the command with the `-sort` option.

Advanced usage
--------------

When reordering is performed the computation can take a lot of time to complete but it
can be greatly speeded up with the `-fast` option. This option prunes assignments that
surpass the displacement tolerance, but if any of the actual atom displacements are larger
than this tolerance then the assignment will fail, or, if they are very close, the
assignment could be suboptimal. In such cases adjust the displacement tolerance to a larger value with the `-tol` option.

The count threshold is used to decide if the procedure is converged. A threshold of 10 
counts is used by default, which works fine for almost all cases, but you can change it
with the `-count` option. To avoid too long computations you can set a maximum number of
random trials with the `-trials` option, the computation will be aborted if it is reach
before the count threshold.

The algorithm always explores multiple possible assignments, but only the best one is
recorded by default. To record additional assignments use the `-rec` option. To print the
stats of the computation use the `-trials` option, but notice that they will be different
on each repeated run due to the use of randomized random seeds.

Command line examples
---------------------

For small atom displacements the default tolerance is enough:

    ./build/molalign examples/Co138_0.xyz examples/Co138_1.xyz -sort -fast
    Optimized RMSD = 0.0506
    
    ./build/molalign examples/Co138_0.xyz examples/Co138_2.xyz -sort -fast
    Optimized RMSD = 0.0977

but for atom displacements larger than the tolerance the assignment will fail:

    ./build/molalign examples/Co138_0.xyz examples/Co138_3.xyz -sort -fast
    Error: Assignment failed

Increasing the tolerance will fix the problem but the calculation will slow down:

    ./build/molalign examples/Co138_0.xyz examples/Co138_3.xyz -sort -fast -tol 0.7
    Optimized RMSD = 0.1973

Printing multiple alignments and stats can be useful to identify rotational symmetric clusters:

    ./build/molalign examples/Co138_0.xyz examples/Co138_1.xyz -sort -fast -rec 5 -stats
     Map    Count    Steps     Total      Real       RMSD
    -----------------------------------------------------
       1       10     10.0      74.4      54.5     0.0506
       2       10      9.0      69.8      48.5     0.0506
       3       16     11.3      83.2      63.6     0.0506
       4        1      2.0       8.4       7.1     0.6652
       5        1      7.0      30.5       9.8     0.6716
    -----------------------------------------------------
    Random trials = 81
    Minimization steps = 706
    Visited local minima > 5

There are three different assignments with the same RMSD indicating that the cluster
has three fold symmetry. Notice that the three optimal symmetric assignments are visited
multiple times while the suboptimal ones are visited only once.

Python examples
---------------

Minimize the RMSD between two Cobalt clusters:

    from ase.io import read
    from molalignlib import assign_atoms
    atoms0 = read('Co138_0.xyz')
    atoms1 = read('Co138_1.xyz')
    assignment = assign_atoms(atoms0, atoms1)
    atoms2 = atoms1[assignment.order]
    atoms2.align_to(atoms0)

*MolAlignLib* uses *ASE* to read and write atomic coordinates.
